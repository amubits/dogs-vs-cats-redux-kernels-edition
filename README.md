# Dogs vs. Cats Image Classification

## Overview
This repository hosts the solution and documentation for the expired Kaggle competition "Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition". The aim is to build an image classification model to distinguish between images of dogs and cats. For more details about the competition, 
visit the [competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/overview).

## Solution Description
The repository includes a detailed description of the approaches taken, including data preprocessing, model selection, training techniques, and hyperparameter tuning. Various strategies such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and ensemble methods may be employed to enhance model performance.

## Code and Notebook
- The code is provided in Jupyter Notebook format (`.ipynb`), facilitating easy review and replication of the analysis.
- The notebook contains step-by-step comments explaining the rationale behind each decision and the implementation details.

## Results
- A section dedicated to the outcomes of the model training, including accuracy metrics and a discussion on the model's performance.
- The final submission score obtained on Kaggle is showcased along with the submission screenshot.

## Usage
Instructions on how to set up the environment, run the notebooks, and reproduce the results are provided. Additionally, guidelines on how to submit your results to Kaggle are included.

## Contribution
